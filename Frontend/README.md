# Database Management for Car Rental and Accomodation Website
### Problem Statement:
In today’s world, every task from as small as grocery shopping to as complex as education is performed online. Renting cars for trips and renting airbnbs is also a task that can efficiently be done online. Our website, iRent, will cater to the severe need of AirBnBs and such a service of car rental because of the absence of such a system in place before. With services like Uber/Careem and hotels being expensive, such a system is really a need of time. This triggered our goal of working on this project and developing a fully functional website to eradicate the problems associated with this stream

### Functionalities
The website will serve two main purposes, i.e. enabling people to make reservations of car(s) for trips and also reserve AirBnBs while visiting cities of Pakistan. AirBnB serve basically means that a customer can rent out an apartment, room or even a house when travelling to some other city. Airbnb expansion is the increased supply of travel accommodations, which could benefit travelers by making travel more affordable. There is evidence that Airbnb increases the supply of short-term travel accommodations and slightly lower prices. Moreover, people can rent out cars for any personal, family, or professional trips wherever they want. The system will keep detailed records of the customers, cars, AirBnBs under the banner along with records of bookings, owners of cars/AirBnBs. The customer can make and/or cancel bookings anytime. 
Admin can perform the following operations after logging in, 
-	Add a car information to the table
-	Add an AirBnb information to the database 
-	Delete a car/Airbnb information from the database
-	Update an existing car/Airbnb’s record from the database. 
A customer/user can perform the following operations: 
-	Search for cars by model, colour, price. 
-	Search for Airbnb’s based on location, price, no_of_rooms
-	Book a car/Airbnb by entering his/her details
-	Update/modify his booking days 
-	Cancel a booking that’s been made previously. 
-	Sign up/register to become a member
